# @continuedev/sdk

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL: This package is in early development and subject to frequent breaking changes without notice.**

This SDK provides a drop-in replacement for OpenAI libraries to easily integrate with Continue assistants.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @continuedev/sdk
```

## Usage

The SDK provides a `Continue.from()` method that initializes an assistant and returns a client you can use as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI SDK:

```typescript
import { Continue } from "@continuedev/sdk";

// Initialize the Continue client with your API key and assistant
const { client, assistant } = await Continue.from({
  apiKey: process.env.CONTINUE_API_KEY,
  assistant: "owner-slug/assistant-slug", // The assistant identifier
});

// Use the client just like the OpenAI SDK
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: assistant.getModel("claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"), // Use the assistant's model
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: assistant.systemMessage }, // Use the assistant's system message
    { role: "user", content: "Hello!" },
  ],
});

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
```
